## 🚀 Key Features
- Secure loan issuance by the platform owner
- Borrowers can repay loans with calculated interest
- No third-party intervention required
- Transparent loan tracking on the blockchain

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Integrate multi-lender pool system for decentralized funding
- Implement collateral mechanisms using ERC20 tokens or NFTs
